# Persistent Loadout Plugin for X-Plane 12

This plugin saves and restores the fuel tank levels on leaving the aircraft and entering the aircraft in cold and dark.

The fuel tank levels are saved on a per livery basis in a JSON file `persistent-loadout.json` inside the livery's
folder.

## Installation

To install, download the latest [release](https://github.com/telephono/persistent-loadout/releases), extract and
copy the `persistent-loadout` folder to the aircraft's `plugins` directory.

# Persistent Loadout Plugin for Shenshee's B720

This plugin saves the fuel tank levels and the Auto Brake, Auto Thrust, HF antenna and VOR/INS/FMC settings on leaving
the aircraft. On re-opening the aircraft, these settings are restored.

The settings are saved on a per-livery basis in X-Plane's `Output/B720` folder.

## Installation

To install, download the latest [release](https://github.com/telephono/persistent-loadout/releases), extract and
copy the `persistent-loadout` folder to the aircraft's `plugins` directory.

## Known Issues

Changing liveries while loaded in the B720 aircraft does not save the loadout for the old livery.
A workaround whould be to load into another aircraft before changing the livery of the B720 and loading back into it.

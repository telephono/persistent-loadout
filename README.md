# Persistent Loadout Plugin for X-Plane 12

This plugin saves the fuel tank levels and the Auto Brake, Auto Thrust and VOR/INS/FMC settings on leaving the aircraft.
On re-opening the aircraft, these settings are restored.

The settings are saved on a per livery basis in a JSON file `persistent-loadout.json` inside the livery's
folder.

## Installation

To install, download the latest [release](https://github.com/telephono/persistent-loadout/releases), extract and
copy the `persistent-loadout` folder to the aircraft's `plugins` directory.
